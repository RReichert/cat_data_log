Cat Data Log
------------

	This basic tool simply concatinates data files from multiple sources into one file. The files are expected to have the following format:

```
	0.010000 12.952956
	0.020000 14.455064
	0.030000 17.094101
```

or:

```
	0.010000 93.104901
	0.020000 125.589172
	0.030000 193.532390
```

and if we concatinated both files, the result would be:

```	
	0.010000 12.952956 93.104901
	0.020000 14.455064 125.589172
	0.030000 17.094101 193.532390
```
